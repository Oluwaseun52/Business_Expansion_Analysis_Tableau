## Business Expansion Analysis Tableau

I had the opportunity to work on a fascinating project with a dynamic start-up laundry company in the United States. Their strategy was to expand rapidly in smaller cities, and they were already thriving in 140 locations when they decided to venture into 10 new cities. The company operates in two distinct regions.

My first task was to determine which of the two sales regions outperformed the other in terms of three crucial metrics: average revenue per city, average marketing spend per city (where less is better), and average ROMI (return on marketing investment). After diving into the data and gaining a deep understanding of the laundry business's nuances, which are closely linked to the population of states and cities, I introduced a new column for ROMI. This analysis revealed that Region 1 was the top performer.

For the second task, I leveraged advanced data analysis techniques, particularly clustering, to categorize the 150 locations, including the new ones, into three distinct groups based on population, revenue, and marketing spend. The trend line on the chart was an eye-opener, and after using highlighting to focus on the 'New' locations, I pinpointed the key locations among the 10 new ones where the company should direct its marketing investments.

This project not only helped me showcase the power of data analytics but also contributed to the company's strategy for expansion.
